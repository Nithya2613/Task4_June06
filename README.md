Using MySQL Workbench, SQL queries were written to extract and analyze data from a structured database.

The database and table (users) were created via the MySQL command prompt, and further analysis including JOIN operations and various SQL queries were performed using MySQL Workbench.

The output of each query was captured as a screenshot, and all SQL queries were saved in a .sql file as part of the deliverables.
